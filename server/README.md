## Philosophy

  The Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making
  it a great solution for single page applications, websites, hybrids, or public
  HTTP APIs.

  Express does not force you to use any specific ORM or template engine. With support for over
  14 template engines via [Consolidate.js](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js),
  you can quickly craft your perfect framework.

### Running Tests

To run the test suite, first install the dependencies, then run `npm test`:

```console
$ npm install
$ npm test
```
